# MNIST DATASET HANDWRITTEN DIGITS CLASSIFICATION


Description : 

	The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It was created by "re-mixing" the samples from NIST's original datasets. The creators felt that since NIST's training dataset was taken from American Census Bureau employees, while the testing dataset was taken from American high school students, it was not well-suited for machine learning experiments. Furthermore, the black and white images from NIST were normalized to fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased, which introduced grayscale levels.
	
How to run the program : 

# before running the program, make sure that you have numpy and kivy installed on your computer.

Execution of code : 

python3 main.py

This program is GUI Based so, by running the above command in the terminal, you will see a GUI menu popped up on the desktop screen.

The GUI consists of Four buttons followed by 3 buttons for number of epochs and 3 buttons for learning rates.

Four buttons are as follows : 
	1. Initialize the dataset
	2. Train the model
	3. Test the model
	4. Generate the graph
	
The GUI also shows the accuracy of the model for the given number of epochs and learning rate.
